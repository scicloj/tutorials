# cljfromr

A basic example of using Clojure from R

## Intro 

This small repo presents an almost-minimal example of calling Clojure from R, while interactively developing both sides.

This may be dramatically useful when one needs to perform some tasks which are fun and fast in Clojure and not-fun and slow in R, such as nested data processing.

It uses [rJava](http://www.rforge.net/rJava/), a JNI-based bridge for calling R from Java.

We have been exploring more comprehensive solutions, decent support for data conversion, easier notation, and a more dynamic experience. All that may become a library in the future.

## Requirement
* R
* rJava
* Leiningen

## Usage

Start R at the main project directory, and do the following:

```{r}
# Load the rJava library.
library(rJava)

# Initialize the JVM.
.jinit()

# Build the Clojure project as a standalone JAR
# (unnecessary if you have already done so).
system("lein uberjar")

# Add the Clojure project jar to the classpath.
.jaddClassPath("target/cljfromr-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar")

# Call the Clojure function `cljfromr.core/foo`.
J("cljfromr.core")$foo(10)

# Start an nREPL server at port 1111
# for interactive Clojure development.
J("cljfromr.core")$startnrepl(1111L)
```

Now you may connect your Clojure development environment to the nREPL session at port 1111, and edit the [Clojure code](src/cljfromr/core.clj) to redefine the function `cljfromr.core/foo` interactively.

Then, try it again from the same R session.

```{r}
J("cljfromr.core")$foo(10)
```

You should see the result updated to match the new definition.

## Known issues

* While connecting to nREPL (see the comments in the code), your development environment might be missing some runtime dependencies such as [cider-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl). To solve that, you may add them (with the relevant version) to [project.clj](./project.clj).
* Underscores and hyphens in names might be a bit tricky due to the Clojure compilation rules. If you are trying this code with different names, you should expect some errors around that until you get it right.
