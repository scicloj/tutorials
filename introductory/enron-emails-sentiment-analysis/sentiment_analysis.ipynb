    "Essentially, `by-key` takes a key function (`kfn`) that it uses to partition the collection it is provided; then, it applies the transform (`xform`) that has been provided to each partition. `by-key` also has an arrity in which you provide a \"value\" function (`vfn`) to extract the \"value part\" from each piece of data. On top of all that, `by-key` returns a transducer, so we can use it in much the same way that we have been using the `map` function as input into any other Clojure function that accepts transducers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we build the call to `by-key`. Well, remember that in Clojure keywords are also functions that if provided a map as an argument will extract the value associated with that key. Therefore we can simply use the `:date` keyword as our partition function, and `:avg-sentiment` as our value function. Finally, we provide a transform function provided by the same library to take the average: `x/avg`:"
